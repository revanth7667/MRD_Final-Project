## Project Overview

This project delves into the intricate dynamics of crime in Los Angeles, employing an extensive dataset from the
Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), covering incidents from 2020 to present day. Utilizing ``Logistic`` and ``Poisson``
regression models, our research aims to unearth the pivotal factors influencing the seriousness of crime commited
and predict the number crime occurrences in a given area and time respectively. Key findings from the first research
objective indicate a relationship between factors like victim demorgraphic and time of day on the seriousness of crime
committed. Findings from the second research objective indicate significant temporal and spatial variations in crime
rates, offering valuable insights for law enforcement and public safety strategies. This study aims to not only enhances the
understanding of crime patterns but also aids in resource allocation and preventive measures.
